# BodySlide-OutfitStudio-DarkishMode
 I went through the .xrc files and converted as much as is possible to a dark theme.

 NOTE: This is JUST the .xrc files, nothing else from BodySlide or OutfitStudio exist here, so download the tools from ![here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/201?tab=description)!

* That's it! After ensuring all 19 .xrc files are in the xrc folder start up BodySlide or OutfitStudio!
* Enjoy your Darkish Mode, your eyes will thank you!
