# BodySlide-OutfitStudio-DarkishMode
 I went through the .xrc files and converted as much as is possible to a dark theme.

# Install Instructions

* Locate current BodySlide/OutfitStudio folder. for MO2 Users this should be in your MO2/mods/BodySlide and Outfit Studio/BodySlide
* Extract this zip folder into the MO2/mods/BodySlide and Outfit Studio/CalienteTools/BodySlide/res/xrc
* That's it! After ensuring all 19 .xrc files are in the xrc folder start up BodySlide or OutfitStudio!
* Enjoy your Darkish Mode, your eyes will thank you!
